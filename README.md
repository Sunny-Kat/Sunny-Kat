- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sunny-Kat
- 👀 I’m interested in biology related topics - currently very fixed on carnivorous plants and their evolution and how things work out on a molecular cellular basis ;)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code, e.g. bash-scripting, r-scripting, python and interpreting biology related datasets.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with nice, mindful and respectful people. :)
- 📫 How to reach me ...
